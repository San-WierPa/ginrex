# Welcome to ginRex's documentation!

Analyse program ... TODO

## Documentation
+ API documentation can be generated by using Sphinx. Build via
```
sphinx-build -b html doc/ doc/_build/html
```

## Git
+ ginRex is located on two repositories simultaneously. Pushing it to both requires following:<br>
For gitlab (main):
```
git remote set-url --add --push origin https://git.uni-wuppertal.de/ag-dlh/reflexafs-data-pipeline.git
```
For github (remote):
```
git remote set-url --add --push origin https://github.com/San-WierPa/ginRex.git
```
Finally, git push (here: both branches are called development):
```
git push origin development
```

## Package build
+ Build all necessary packages that Python will require:
```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```
 + Note for anaconda users: Correct environment needs to be activated.

## TODO
